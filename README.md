99Reflectances is reflectance data taken from the CES1nm tab of the IES_TM-30-15_Advanced_CalculationTool_v1.02.xlsm file. (first column is wavelength, remaining columns are different reflectance spectra)

99Reflectances_sampleTypes is data taken from the CES1nm tab of the IES_TM-30-15_Advanced_CalculationTool_v1.02.xlsm file showing the sample type of each reflectance spectra.

318Illuminants is illuminant data taken from the MultipleSPDCalc_1nm tab of the IES_TM-30-15_Advanced_CalculationTool_v1.02.xlsm file. (first column is wavelength, remaining columns are different illuminant spectra)

The IES_TM-30-15_Advanced_CalculationTool_v1.02.xlsm file comes from 10.1364/OE.23.015888
